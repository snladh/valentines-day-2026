# valentines-day-2026
A small interactive Valentine’s Day website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a surprise for my girlfriend. It includes mini-games, a gift-finding treasure hunt, lottery/spin-wheel choices, password unlocks, animated hearts/confetti, and surprise reveal pages with customizable messages and themes.
