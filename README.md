# valentines-day-2026

A small interactive Valentine’s Day website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a surprise for my girlfriend. It includes mini-games, a gift-finding treasure hunt, lottery / spin-wheel choices, password unlocks, animated hearts and confetti, and surprise reveal pages with customizable messages and themes.

## Project Status
This project is actively evolving and will continue to receive new features, UI improvements, and additional mini-games over time.

## README Roadmap
This README will gradually expand into a full handbook including:
- How to run the project
- Folder and code structure locations
- Feature explanations and game flow
- Customization options (themes, prizes, messages)
- Deployment steps
- Update summaries / changelog

## Goal
Create a fun, lightweight, and playful interactive experience that can be easily modified and extended with new surprises.
